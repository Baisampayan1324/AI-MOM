# AI MOM - Bug Fixes and UI Improvements Summary

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Version:** 1.1.0

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Backend Session Endpoint 404 Errors ✅
**Problem:** Extension was calling non-existent API endpoints:
- `POST /api/start-meeting-session` → 404
- `POST /api/end-meeting-session` → 404

**Solution:**
- Removed calls to these unimplemented endpoints from `screen-capture.js`
- Removed the `startBackendSession()` and `endBackendSession()` methods
- Added comments indicating session tracking is not yet implemented
- Core functionality (WebSocket transcription) remains intact

**Files Modified:**
- `extension/content/screen-capture.js`

---

### 2. Audio Upload 404 Error ✅
**Problem:** Popup was calling wrong endpoint for audio file upload:
- Calling: `POST /upload-audio` → 404
- Actual endpoint: `POST /api/process-audio`

**Solution:**
- Updated FormData field name from `audio_file` to `file` (matches backend expectation)
- Changed endpoint URL from `/upload-audio` to `/api/process-audio`
- Added better error handling with detailed error messages
- Added file size validation (500MB max)
- Added upload progress indicators

**Files Modified:**
- `extension/popup/popup.js`

---

### 3. Microphone Permission Error Handling ✅
**Problem:** Generic "Permission dismissed" error without helpful context

**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive error handling for different permission scenarios:
  - `NotAllowedError`: "Permission dismissed. Please allow microphone access and try again."
  - `NotFoundError`: "No microphone found. Please connect a microphone and try again."
  - `NotReadableError`: "Microphone is already in use by another application."
  - `OverconstrainedError`: "Microphone does not support the requested settings."
- Improved audio constraints with echo cancellation and noise suppression
- Added browser API support check

**Files Modified:**
- `extension/popup/popup.js`

---

### 4. Audio Processing Result Display ✅
**Problem:** Results from backend weren't displayed properly

**Solution:**
- Rewrote `displayTranscriptResults()` to handle backend's actual response format
- Added support for displaying:
  - Transcription text
  - Speaker segments (if available)
  - Word count
  - Full summary
  - Key points
  - Action items
  - Conclusion
- Added proper formatting with speaker IDs and timestamps
- Shows quick actions after successful processing

**Files Modified:**
- `extension/popup/popup.js`

**Files Modified:**
- `extension/popup/popup.css`
- `extension/popup/popup.js`

---

### 2. Better Progress Indicators ✨

- [x] Audio file upload works with correct endpoint
- [x] Microphone permission errors show helpful messages
- [x] Screen capture works without session tracking
- [x] Transcript results display correctly
- [x] Summary sections render properly
- [x] Progress bar updates during upload
- [x] Notifications appear and auto-dismiss
- [x] File size validation works

## Known Limitations

1. **Session Tracking**: Backend endpoints for `start-meeting-session` and `end-meeting-session` are not implemented. These are optional features for future development.

2. **File Upload Size**: Limited to 500MB per file. This is a frontend restriction matching backend expectations.

3. **Browser Compatibility**: Microphone API requires HTTPS or localhost. Won't work on insecure HTTP sites.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Backend Session Tracking** (Optional)
   - Add `/api/start-meeting-session` endpoint
   - Add `/api/end-meeting-session` endpoint
   - Enable metadata tracking for meetings

2. **Add Real-time Transcription Display**
   - Show live transcription as it's being processed
   - Update word count in real-time
   - WebSocket integration for streaming results

3. **Enhance Speaker Identification**
   - Better speaker diarization display
   - Color-coded speakers
   - Speaker name editing

4. **Export Functionality**
   - Export to PDF
   - Export to DOCX
   - Export to TXT with timestamps

---

## Deployment

All changes are backwards compatible and ready for deployment:

```bash
# Extension files
cd extension
# Reload extension in Chrome

# Backend (no changes needed)
cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```
